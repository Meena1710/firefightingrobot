Overview
This project demonstrates a fire-fighting robot that can detect flames and extinguish them by spraying water using a water pump. The robot uses an Arduino Uno microcontroller, flame sensors for flame detection, servo motors to aim the water pump, and DC motors to drive the robot.

The robot is designed to autonomously navigate towards the fire, detect the flame, and use a water pump to extinguish the fire.

Components
Hardware
Arduino Uno - The main controller that processes inputs and controls the robot's motors and sensors.
Flame Sensor - Detects fire/flames within a certain range and sends the signal to the Arduino.
DC Motors (2) - Used to drive the robot in forward, backward, and turning directions.
Servo Motor - Controls the angle of the water pump to aim and spray water.
Water Pump - Connected to the servo to spray water to extinguish the fire.
Battery Pack - Powers the Arduino and motors.
Motor Driver Module (e.g., L298N) - Used to drive the motors with adequate current.
Chassis - The physical structure that holds all the components together.
Sensors and Components
Flame Sensor (e.g., YF-S201) - Detects fire presence.
Servo Motor (e.g., SG90) - Controls the direction of water spray.
DC Motors (e.g., 5V DC motors) - Provides movement for the robot.
Water Pump (e.g., mini water pump) - Sprays water for fire extinguishing.
